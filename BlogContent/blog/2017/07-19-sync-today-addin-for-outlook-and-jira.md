This post is about re-entering the Outlook synchronization space with [Sync.Today Addin for JIRA and Microsoft Outlook](https://github.com/hsharpsoftware/publish/raw/master/sync-addin-for-outlook-and-jira/setup.exe). 

## TL;DR
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-QahH2NSJu0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

## The rationale
We believe it is always better to have all the tasks on one place. That is why we decided to synchronize all your JIRA issues to Microsoft Outlook tasks.

Currently we synchronize JIRA issues assigned to the user that is logging to the Sync.Today Addin for JIRA and Microsoft Outlook. This is the same as "Assinged to me" view in JIRA.

We transfer:

- JIRA issue **Key**, **Subject** and link to task *Subject*
- JIRA issue **Description** and **Comments** to *Body*
